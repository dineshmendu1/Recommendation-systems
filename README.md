Classification model based:- It works by understanding the features of the user and applying the classification algorithm to decide whether the user is interested or not in the prodcut.

Content based recommedations:- It is based on the information on the contents of the item rather than on the user opinions.The main idea is if the user likes an item then he or she will like the "other" similar item.

Collaberative Filtering:- It is based on assumption that people like things similar to other things they like, and things that are liked by other people with similar taste. it is mainly of two types: a) User-User b) Item -Item

Hybrid Approaches:- This system approach is to combine collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and other approaches .
